Installation
===============

Choose your version (latest is better) and download it [here](https://github.com/patrickpr/YAOG/releases)

Just unzip and run the exe.
All dependencies (SSL & Qt) are packaged inside the zip file.

If you have any issues about missing DLL, first try to install Microsoft VisualC runtime (vc_redist x64). If it doesn't help, please open an Issue

Have a look at the [doc](02-maindoc.md) now !

Build your own
===============

Here are the guidelines to compile YAOG and OpenSSL on your own : [compile](80-compile.md)
